# Employee Experience Survey Analysis
Welcome to the Employee Experience Survey Analysis project! This repository contains a detailed analysis of employee survey data aimed at uncovering insights about job satisfaction, engagement, and other key
factors. Below, you’ll find an overview of what this project is about, the steps I followed, and how you can explore the findings.

## Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze employee feedback, identify areas of strength, and highlight opportunities for improvement. The survey data covered various dimensions, such as Job Satisfaction,
Work-Life Balance, Team Collaboration, and Compensation Satisfaction, measured using Likert scales.
By exploring patterns across demographics (age, gender, department), I aimed to answer key questions like:
  Which areas of employee experience need attention?
  Are there significant differences in experiences across departments or demographics?

### Steps I Followed
### 1. Understanding the Data
The dataset consisted of employee feedback across multiple categories, with responses measured on a Likert scale. I first cleaned and transformed the data, mapping Likert scale responses
(e.g., Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree) to numerical values (1 to 5).  

### 2. Descriptive Statistics
To understand overall trends, I calculated key metrics like:
Mean: Average score for each category.
Median: Midpoint value, indicating central tendency.
Mode: Most common response.
Standard Deviation: Variation in responses across employees.

### 3. Exploring Trends by Demographics
I segmented the data to see how metrics varied across age brackets and departments:
  Younger employees (18-24) reported higher satisfaction and engagement compared to mid-career professionals (35-44).
  Departments like Finance and HR had the highest satisfaction, while IT scored the lowest.

### 4. Inferential Statistics
I conducted hypothesis testing and correlation analysis to dive deeper into the data:
T-Test: Compared Job Satisfaction between departments (e.g., HR vs. IT). The result showed no statistically significant difference, but IT’s low scores were notable.
Correlation Analysis: Explored the relationship between Work-Life Balance and Overall Engagement. The weak correlation (r = -0.36) suggests no strong link, but qualitative patterns revealed a need for better
balance.

### 5. Visualizing the Insights
I used Power BI to create a dashboard with clear visuals, including:
Clustered Bar Charts: Showed department-wise satisfaction and engagement.
Pie Charts: Highlighted demographic breakdowns like age and gender.
Gauge Charts: Summarized overall engagement at a glance.

### 6. Key Findings
Strengths: Finance and HR departments excel in engagement and satisfaction.
Concerns: IT struggles with the lowest scores, signaling a need for targeted support.
Opportunities: Mid-career professionals (35-44) need more career development and mentorship.

## Recommendations
Support Low-Performing Departments: Address issues in IT by focusing on workload fairness, management support, and recognition.
Enhance Work-Life Balance: Introduce flexible schedules and wellness initiatives to boost engagement.
Focus on Mid-Career Employees: Offer skill development programs and growth opportunities to retain talent in the 35-44 age bracket.

### Conclusion
This project provides actionable insights into employee satisfaction and engagement, empowering organizations to take data-driven steps toward improving the workplace experience.
